# Insurer demo build ledger

Updated at the end of every iteration. Newest facts win. Keep it short.

Worktree: `Projects/iip_saas_insurer_demo`, branch `build/insurer-demo-2026-10-27`, from dff5ab3. Local only, no deploys.

## Decisions made (owner away, recommended choices)

- One generic per-workspace store, table `WorkspaceRecords` (tenant, workspace, kind, key, JSON), behind `IWorkspaceRecordStore`. Brand, templates, rules, events, decision log and outcomes use it, so each piece needs no migration of its own. It carries a tenant id, so export and purge cover it automatically. Event volume can move to its own table later if a bank sends large files.
- Whose assistant Kato is: `KatoBrand.Current` now reads an ambient per-request brand (AsyncLocal, `KatoBrand.Use`) and falls back to the start-up default. Webhook inbound, outreach drafting, triage and conversation insights resolve the workspace brand at their entry points. The `Assistant:*` settings remain the default for workspaces that set nothing.
- Life versus general is `InsuranceClass` on each product (loan protector, funeral and school fees are life; the rest general) and `LineFocus` on the brand filters products by it.
- Brand API is `GET/PUT /api/v1/workspace/brand`, ConfigureIntegrations permission, audited (`workspace.brand.saved`). Its screen comes with piece 2 (scenario switch) and piece 14 (company profile).
- Nile Life needs life covers for an insurer: the catalogue has no Nile Shield life products, so piece 2 adds them (decision there).

## Verified so far

- Piece 1: dotnet build clean; full Api.Tests 1575 passed (incl. 12 new in WorkspaceBrandTests: workspace isolation, concurrent brands, line focus); Domain.Tests 722 passed. Migration AddWorkspaceRecords generated, not applied to any database.

## Deploy checklist (for when the owner says deploy)

- Build API and portal from this branch, run `db-migrate`, check `/health/ready`, confirm the deploy guard passes (no demo banner).
- Owner actions: submit templates to Meta, Microsoft and Google app registrations, counsel review of the security pack.

## Questions for the owner (asked at the very end)

- None yet.
